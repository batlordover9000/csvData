# csvData

## Todo:

- [ ] Scale to really large csv files (2gb maybe?)
- [ ] Get the total number of rows
- [ ] Get the headers for the csv
- [ ] Create a MySQL 'create table' code from the file 
- [ ] Guess the types and lengths (when required) of each column
- [ ] count null or blank values in a col
